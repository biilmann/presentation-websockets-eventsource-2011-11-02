Websockets and EventSource
==========================

This was a presentation I gave in MadridJS November 2, 2011.

To see the minimalist slides open index.html (made with Big JS https://github.com/tmcw/big)

The meaty part of the presentation is in the *examples* dir.

In the presentation the examples were shown in this order:

1.  long.html
2.  long.js
3.  $ node long.js
4.  handshake.md
5.  ws.html
6.  ws.js
7.  $ node ws.js
8.  event-stream.md
9.  es.html
10. es.js
11. $ node es.js

For a fully hosted EventSource service, check
http://www.eventsourcehq.com

From there you'll also find an open source, powerful, scalable bridge between RabbitMQ
and EventSource implemented in Haskell.

Cheers,
Mathias
